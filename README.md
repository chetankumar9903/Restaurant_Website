## Created as a Learning Project

This website was created as part of a web development course, where I gained hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive websites using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and AJAX.

## Getting Started

To explore the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The website uses Bootstrap for styling, jQuery for interactivity, and AJAX for dynamic content loading.
